# React-Redux-NetNinja-tutorial-series

I have taken up the initiative, to follow a complete React tutorial (with Redux), from the beginning to the end. This repository, contains all the programs I have worked on, during the tutorial series. The objective for this tutorial series, is to teach the basic concepts, in the React framework (JavaScript library for Frontend Web development), from the ground up. This is integrated with a basic tutorial series, in Redux. In addition, the base languages that were of concern are: javascript, html, Materialized css and css.
